## What is OpenKrab?

OpenKrab is a **personal AI assistant** written in **Rust** that connects your favorite chat apps — Telegram, Slack, Discord, WhatsApp, Signal, iMessage, and more — to AI agents. It provides native performance, memory safety, and efficient resource usage for self-hosted deployment.

**Who is it for?** Developers and power users who want a fast, secure, personal AI assistant they can message from anywhere — without giving up control of their data or relying on hosted services.

**What makes it different?**

- **Rust-powered**: Native performance, memory safety, single binary deployment
- **Multi-channel**: One Gateway serves Telegram, Slack, Discord, WhatsApp, Signal, and more simultaneously
- **AI-native**: Built for AI agents with tool use, sessions, memory (vector + text search), and multi-agent routing
- **Voice-enabled**: Wake word detection, talk mode, VAD, and audio processing
- **Plugin system**: WASM runtime with hot reload and sandboxing
- **Open source**: MIT licensed, community-driven

**What do you need?** Rust 1.75+ (or pre-built binary), an API key (OpenAI/Anthropic/Gemini), and 5 minutes.

The Gateway is the single source of truth for sessions, routing, and channel connections.

## Quick start

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install OpenKrab">
    ```bash
    # From source
    git clone https://github.com/openkrab/openkrab.git
    cd openkrab
    cargo build --release
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure and start the Gateway">
    ```bash
    # Set your AI provider
    krabkrab config set providers.openai.api_key "sk-..."

    # Start the gateway
    krabkrab gateway --port 18789
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Send messages">
    ```bash
    krabkrab telegram --to @username --text "Hello from OpenKrab!"
    krabkrab ask "What's on my calendar today?"
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

Need the full install and dev setup? See [Quick start](/start/quickstart).

## Dashboard

Open the browser dashboard after the Gateway starts.

- Local default: [http://127.0.0.1:18789/](http://127.0.0.1:18789/)
- Remote access: [Web surfaces](/web) and [Tailscale](/gateway/tailscale)

## Configuration

Config lives at `~/.config/krabkrab/config.toml`.

- If you **do nothing**, OpenKrab uses default settings with OpenAI provider.
- If you want to lock it down, start with `channels.telegram.allow_from` and rate limiting.

Example:

```toml
[channels.telegram]
allow_from = ["@username"]
rate_limit = 100

[providers.openai]
api_key = "sk-..."
model = "gpt-4o"

[memory]
enabled = true
embedding_provider = "openai"
```
